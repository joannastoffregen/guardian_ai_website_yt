## Style Guide Governance

website-guidelines/STYLE_GUIDE.md is the authoritative global design system.

Section specification files (website-sections/*.md) are inputs and may contain
section-specific or experimental design decisions.

When implementing a section:
- If a design decision is reusable or appears in more than one section,
  it MUST be documented in website-guidelines/STYLE_GUIDE.md.
- If a design decision is section-specific, keep it in the section file only.

If implementation diverges from website-guidelines/STYLE_GUIDE.md:
1. If the new approach looks/works better, keep it.
2. Update website-guidelines/STYLE_GUIDE.md to match what we actually implemented.
3. Add a changelog entry noting what changed and why.
4. Do not duplicate section-specific instructions in the style guide.

Never silently diverge from the style guide
